<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Nishchaya Sharma, a 20-year-old Computer Science Engineering enthusiast currently navigating the exciting realm of B.Tech CSE in my third year at JK Lakshmipat University. My academic journey has been shaped by my earlier years at My Own School in Jaipur, where I laid the foundation for my passion in technology and problem-solving.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in the world of coding and algorithms, you'll often find me exploring the thrilling landscapes of gaming and esports. I have a particular affinity for games like BGMI, Valorant, and various FPS titles, where I enjoy honing my skills and competing in virtual arenas.</p>

<p>Beyond the digital realm, I have a soft spot for literature. The latest addition to my reading list was "It Starts with Us," a book that left a lasting impression on me. The ability of words to weave captivating stories and evoke emotions is something I truly appreciate.</p>
<p>One of my favorite pastimes is spending time with our furry friends. I have a genuine love for dogs, and you can often find me at the International Dog Bazaar (IDB), where I indulge in meeting and playing with new canine companions. The joy and unconditional love they bring into our lives never cease to amaze me.</p>

<p>In the realm of entertainment, anime holds a special place in my heart. Naruto, with its compelling storyline and memorable characters, stands out as my all-time favorite. The rich narratives and unique artistry of anime never fail to captivate my imagination.</p>
<p>As I continue to navigate the dynamic world of technology, gaming, literature, and the joy of connecting with our four-legged friends, I am always open to new experiences and opportunities that enrich my journey. Let's embark on this adventure together!</p>
